What is work-life balance?</h1>
<p>Maintaining a work-life balance is about separating your personal and professional lives without allowing one to encroach upon the other. Both are important, neither should be neglected.</p>

<h2>
<i class="fa fa-child" style="font-size:28px;color:#5fc3e4"></i>
5 reasons why</h2>
<br>
<div>
1. We become less susceptible to burnouts.<br>
<br>
2. We experience fewer health problems: physically and mentally.<br>
<br>
3. Attention is paid where due.<br>
<br>
4. It increases productivity.<br>
<br>
5. It increases overall wellness.<br>

Tips/resources</h2>
<div>
Here are a few ways you can achieve a work-life balance that works for you, so you don’t end up burned out and overwhelmed, and so you don’t put your health at risk.<br>
<br>
1. Take advantage of "me time." When you hear "self-care," maybe you think of meditation and face masks. But taking care of yourself is important! You need to make sure you take the time to reset and recharge, whether that’s going to the gym or allowing yourself a binge-session of your favorite show.<br>
<br>
2. Learn to say "no." Saying no can seem impossible, especially at work. Trust me, I know. But if you agree to attend every event, take on every project, or manage every co-worker, you’ll find yourself with no time left…<br>
And the worst type of betrayal is the kind you do to yourself. It’s okay to say no to things that stress you out, as long as it’s warranted.<br>
<br>
3. Create boundaries. Don’t take your laptop to bed with you, or answer your boss’ calls at the dinner table. Just because you’re physically accessible all the time doesn’t mean you have to be. Set boundaries with your employer so you both understand you’re availability.<br>

Our Approach</h1>
<div>
<p>
Here in M&M, through empirical evidence we plan to address this issue of feeling lost in understanding what work-life balance means and feels like in your life.<br>
<br>
Through our coaching sessions we aim to conceptualise work- family balance as something that needs to be regulated together from an action regulation perspective as the successful joint pursuit of work and family goals.<br>
<br>
Building on insights from the work-family literature, action regulation theory, and multiple goals research, we propose and apply a theoretical model that explains how people can jointly attain work and family goals.<br>
<br>
We believe through feedback, we are able to monitor the progress across work and family goals, and fine tune your strategies.  Our models used in our sessions offer new insights into and research implications for work-family balance and helps develop personalised practical interventions that result in improved management of the work-family interface.<br>
</p>

About us</h1>
<div>
<p>
Most of us are aware that work-life balance is an important part of our wellness. The two (work and life) are highly intertwined.
<br>
We know when the balance is good, and we can feel it affect us when one (or even sometimes both) are disrupting our balance.
<br>
<br>
Yet, who can honestly admit they know how to restore an equilibrium?
<br>
Individual-level strategies for achieving effectiveness and satisfaction across work and family roles have not received sufficient attention. Do you know what is the best way to restore your balance? Do you even know what balance in your life looks like? According to recent research, an increasing number of individuals have an increased academic and general interest in how people can successfully manage work and family roles (Allen, 2012; Greenhaus & Kossek, 2014).
<br>
<br>
M&M provides a unique service catered just for you. Through our consultations, we are able to personalise theories and models to your life. Highlighting the aspects of your life you do already that works towards balance, and also provide advice that might aid in restoring balance. Check out “Our Approach” to get a little more insight of the consultations. Also please feel free to contacts us by using our contact form.
